# cc3d_kumar_cell_migration_tuning_ECM

Code originally developed by authors of the following paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/srep19905 

Authors Sandeep Kumar, Aastha Kapoor, Sejal Desai, Mandar M. Inamdar & Shamik Sen used a CompuCell3D (CC3D) model of Cell Migration by tuning the extracellular matrix density and organization using CC3D version 3 (Python 2). Original code can be found here: https://github.com/sandeep13712/CellMigration.git

This repository is an update of that code to be compatible with CC3D version 4 (Python 3).
